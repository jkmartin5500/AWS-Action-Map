# AWS-Action-Map
A mapping of all available AWS Services to the IAM Actions you can call on them. Generated by scraping the [Create Policy wizard](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/policies/create) to categorize all actions to the elevation level (Read only, Read Write, Tagging, etc). Project was necessary becasue I couldn't find the mapping they used to create the wizard.
